# Question 1

Write a class that takes in two numbers and stores them in class variables one and two.

# Question 2

Write a class that takes in two numbers and stores them in the class variables x and y.  Also write a method add, which returns the sum of x and y.

# Question 3

Write a class that takes in two numbers and stores them in the class variables x and y.  Also write a method multiply, which returns the product of x and y.

# Question 4

Write a class that takes in a list of numbers and stores them in the class variable List.  Also write a method that returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.

# Question 5

Write a class that takes in a list of numbers and stores them in the class variable List.  Also write a method that returns the product of all the numbers in the list.

# Question 6

Write a class that takes in a list of numbers and stores them in a class variable List.  Assume the list is of length at least 6.  Write a method that returns the rolling average of the list.  The rolling average sliding window should be length 3.

# Question 7

Write a class that takes in a list of numbers and stores them in a class variable List.  Assume the list is of length at least 6.  Write a method that returns the rolling median of the list.  The rolling median sliding window should be length 3.

# Question 8

Expand on the class written in class (called DescribeData).  Add the rolling mean and rolling median methods to this class.  The sliding window size for these methods should be variable.  Pass in a default parameter of 3 to the variable.

# Question 9

Add the geometric mean to the class written in class (called DescribeData). This method should take in no parameters.

# Question 10

Add a interquartile range method to class written in class (called DescribeData).  This method should take in no parameters.
