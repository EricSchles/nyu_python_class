#Question 1

Write a python a function that implements the correlation between two variables

Here's the formula for correlation: http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/statcorr.php

#Question 2

Write a class that implements the Node of a linked list

#Question 3

Write a class that uses the previously defined Node to implement a linked list.  It should support the following methods:

1) inserting - method definition: insert(self,value), returns nothing

2) deletion - method definition: delete(self,index_to_delete), returns nothing

3) containment - method definition: contains(self, value), returns True or False

#Question 4

Given the list x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

What does x[0] return?

What does x[-1] return?

What does x[:3] return?

What does x[:] return?

What does x[:27] return?

Hint: you should simply run all of these and report the output.

#Question 5

Write a python function that implements multiplication.  Hint: Using a for loop and the addition operator.

#Question 6

Write a python function that implements division.  Hint: Use looping and repeated subtraction.

#Question 7

Write a class that implements a triangle object.  It should have 3 tuples as data called:

point_one

point_two

point_three

Each one should be a tuple with two integers - an x value and a y value.

Also you should implement the following methods:

1) Area - a method for calculating the area of the triangle: definition area(self) #returns a number

2) Perimeter -  a method for calculating the perimeter of the triangle: definition perimeter(self) #returns a number

#Question 8

Write a class that implements a circle.  It should include two data points:

1) the center of the circle ( a tuple of two integers )

2) the length of a line from the center of the circle to it's edge (called it's radius)

You should also write methods with calculate the following:

1) Area

2) perimeter

#Question 9

Use the linked list above to store 10000 numbers in the linked list.  

Then delete a randomly chosen number (you can use random.randint to do this)

Finally write a method that checks for containment.

Record the running times of each of these methods - use time.time()

Write methods that do the same thing with the list object that comes with python - []

Which method is faster for each case?  Why?  Explain why one method runs faster or slower.

#Question 10 - Extra credit

Write a method that implements a general purpose way to calculate the nth fibonnaci number.

Hint use recursion.
