Rule 1)

make sure you have a variable that you can reduce or store all of your computations in.  

Rule 2)

Make sure the variable you use is initialized correctly.  

In the case of summation, make sure to start with a value of 0 in your accumulation.

In the case of product, make sure to start with a value of 1 in your accumulation.

Rule 3)

Make sure to take care to follow the notation - every sum and every product needs to be initialized with a variable that can store information for later use.

Rule 4)

All computation after the sum and product symbols occurs in the inner most for loop.
